The ICPC World Finals Ranking Dataset, available on Kaggle, provides information about the performance of teams from different universities around the world which participated in the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) World Finals from 1999 onwards. This dataset contains data about the rank of each team, the university they represented, the year of the competition, and the country where the university is located.
The ICPC is one of the most prestigious programming competitions in the world, where teams of three students compete to solve algorithmic problems in a time-restricted environment. It is organized by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), and the competition has several rounds before the finals, including regional competitions and online contests.
This dataset contains information about the top-performing universities in the ICPC World Finals from 1999 to the present day. The dataset includes 21 features, including the team name, rank, the name of the university, the region and country of the university, and the number of problems solved by the team during the competition. The dataset also provides some information about the teams ranking in the regional contests, which serves as a qualifier for the world finals.
This dataset can be used to perform statistical analyses, trend analyses and machine learning models. Researchers could use the dataset to identify the top-performing universities and countries over the years, study the distribution of problems solved by the teams in different years, and make predictions about future contests based on past performance. Additionally, teachers and mentors could use this dataset to understand and pin down concepts that could be useful to prepare their students for the contest.

About author
I create this dataset to save all information about ICPC WF, my first passion when I just begin in IT. I don't have chance to attend WF, but I have achieved some rewards in ICPC Asia Regional contests, a World Finals qualification in Asia Pacific held by OLP/ICPC Vietnam:

Honorable mention in ICPC 2020 Asia Can Tho Regional Contest. (Team: No Girl No AC)
Honorable mention in ICPC 2021 Asia Hanoi Regional Contest. (Team: The Phoenix Rises)
Bronze medal in ICPC 2022 Asia Ho Chi Minh City Regional Contest. (Team: HUSC.[401]_UnauthorizeD)
My challenge:

Predict which university where the next champions team come from.
Can your university or your country achieve medal in future WF?
